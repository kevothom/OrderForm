This HTML app consists of two webpages and a CSS page. The first one which is the home page is the OrderForm.html. This is a webform that takes a customer general information for filling out an order form then clicking on the Submit button to send to the 2nd page called OrderForm2.html. The homepage has a heading followed by a number of labels and input boxes for the user's information, and a submit button at the bottom of page. Once the customer information is inputted, the customer clicks on the submit button and is directed to the next page which thanks the customer for filling out the order form. Both pages have a source image on them and a CSS file which formats the color background of both pages to grey.
